	 * String Class:
	 * -String is the most widely used class in java. It helps us store and manipulate text based data.
	 * 
	 * Why should we learn about String class and its methods:
	 * -String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data.
	 * that way we don't need to write any logic we can simply create the object of the String class and use 
	 * the method from that class. 
	 * 
	 * Syntax:
	 * 	String str=new String("I can't sleep if I don't solve repls");  //first syntax
	 * 	String str2="I can't sleep if I don't solve repls";				//second syntax
	 * 	str2.length();
	 *
