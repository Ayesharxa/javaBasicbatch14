		 * What is type casting/
		 * type casting is converting one data type to another data type
		 * Why should I learn about it
		 * So that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easy
		 * or when we will be working in teams we will be able to merge the code.
		 * What is the syntax for type casting?
		 * When we are converting something smaller to larger we don't need to do anything
		 * it happens automatically (implicit) we just assign the variable.
		 * 
		 * int box=1234;
		 * 
		 * long box2=box;  //this is how it works 
		 * 
		 * however when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type
		 * then this is how we do it:
		 * 
		 * long box=1245454;
		 * 
		 * int box2=(int) box;  narrowing or explicit requires manual conversion
		 *
