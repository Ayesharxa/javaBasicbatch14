Type Casting:
Type casting is converting one date typt to another one..
For example we can convert a short byte to byte a lont to float etc.
There are two main types:

-Implicit/widening/automatic
When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens 
when we assign a smaller data type to a larger data type because there 
is no data loss in this conversion

-Explicit/narrowing/manual
When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type.  It does not happen 
automatically we have to do it explicit manually.

Why should we learn type casting?
-When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code 
from others to save time and we may need to convert data types to make 
our cod compatible with their code.
What is the syntax for type casting?
-WE use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example:
if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we can do it.
long var1=250;
int var2=(int)var1;  //its EXPLICIT/NARROWING/MANUAL
double var3=var2;    //IMPLICIT/WIDENING/AUTOMATIC
float f=250.5f;
double d=f;			//IMPLICIT/WIDENING/AUTOMATIC

If else conditions
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
Why should we learn about if else?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website 
	our programs need to make a lot of decisions.
	IF (the given username and password matches)
	{go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
	
	if (video freezing) {
System.out.println("Stop video")}
{else
System.out.println("Keep video")}

What is the syntax for IF else conditions
	boolean isHungry=true;
	
	if(isHungry){
	System.out.println("Please Eat Something");
	}else{
	System.out.println("Let's build some Java programs")
